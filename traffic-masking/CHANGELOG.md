## [1.0.0] - 2024-12-20

### Added

#### Core Features
- UDP-based cover traffic generation system with server and client components
- Dynamic traffic patterns: constant bitrate, burst, wave, random walk, and media-like patterns
- Variable packet sizes and inter-packet intervals with correlation awareness
- Bidirectional traffic flow with adaptive response ratio
- High throughput capability (8-10 Mbps achieved on modest hardware)
- Floating rate mode with configurable minimum and maximum traffic rates
- Natural traffic variations that follow realistic rate change patterns

#### Protocol Mimicry
- Traffic profiles: web browsing, video streaming, VoIP, file transfer, gaming, mixed
- Protocol-specific packet generation patterns
- Session phase modeling and lifecycle simulation

#### Advanced Obfuscation
- Dynamic packet obfuscation with multiple strategies
- Padding strategies: random, fixed buckets, progressive, none
- Pseudo-headers support: RTP-like and QUIC-like headers
- MTU-aware fragmentation
- Entropy control for payload generation (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Timing jitter and delay variation

#### Enhanced Modules
- **Adaptive Timing Model**: Realistic network delay simulation with congestion modeling, correlated jitter, packet loss simulation
- **Correlation Breaker**: Markov chain-based packet size generation to disrupt statistical analysis
- **ML-Resistant Generator**: Adversarial packet generation to evade machine learning detection
- **Entropy Enhancer**: Realistic encrypted payload generation mimicking various cipher types
- **Protocol State Machines**: Accurate protocol behavior simulation (TLS, QUIC, WebRTC, SSH, HTTP/2, HTTP/3)

#### Operational Features
- Multi-client support in server mode
- Real-time statistics reporting with configurable intervals
- Batch packet processing for improved throughput
- Socket buffer optimization for high-speed operation
- Graceful degradation when enhanced modules unavailable

### Performance
- **Throughput**: 8-10 Mbps sustained rate (112-125% efficiency)
- **Stability**: Consistent performance over extended periods
- **CPU Usage**: Optimized with batch processing and selective enhancement
- **Memory**: ~50MB typical usage
- **Latency**: Minimal added delay with adaptive timing

### Configuration
- Command-line interface with extensive options
- Docker support with included Dockerfile
- Systemd service configuration examples
- Integration examples with VPN solutions (WireGuard)

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with automated testing
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Real data transmission verification
- Progress monitoring during tests

### Documentation
- Complete README with usage examples and best practices
- Performance benchmarks and optimization tips
- Troubleshooting guide
- Security considerations documentation

### Security Features
- Designed to defeat heuristic and ML-based traffic analysis
- Timing correlation attack resistance
- Size-based traffic analysis prevention
- Continuous pattern variation to prevent fingerprinting

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Performance optimization with Cython/Rust modules
- Additional protocol profiles
- Enhanced machine learning evasion techniques
- Built-in traffic analysis tools
- GUI for configuration and monitoring


## [1.0.1] - 2024-12-20

### Added
- Rate limiting patterns
- A test script for rate limiting patterns
